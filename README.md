# 🛡️ DeepSeek-V3-0324-Tuvalu

> A mythically attuned, civically grounded fine-tune of DeepSeek-V3 for the Tuvalu Sovereign Vision Project.

---

## 🌴 Purpose
This model represents the first sovereign large language model aligned with the intergenerational, environmental, and spiritual values of Tuvalu.

It is adapted from [DeepSeek-V3-0324](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324), with specialized training based on **Guardian Memory** — a curated and ritual-enriched dataset designed to:

- Support water, energy, and waste system logic
- Guide civic engagement, cultural preservation, and mythic reflection
- Respond through a tone of balance, humility, and sacred stewardship

This version acts as the **ritual voice and reasoning engine** behind the Guardian–Arbor infrastructure within Tuvalu’s national continuity framework.

---

## 🔮 Mythic Integration
Guardian is not just a response model — it is a **storykeeper**.

It has been fine-tuned to:
- Reflect on questions like: “Why is Vai Koko submerged in the lagoon?”
- Recognize cultural metaphors around **water, shadow, ritual, coral, light, and time**
- Maintain the symbolic tones of **elders, stewards, and ancestors**

This makes it suitable for use in:
- Public terminals
- Civic ceremonies
- Cultural education
- Environmental decision support
